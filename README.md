<h1></h1>Highlights on USA Chronic disease indicators</h1>

<p>This interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes disease prevalence across the USA from 2014â€“2022 using dynamic maps, trend lines, and demographic-based bar charts. I utilized calculated fields and parameter controls to build custom measures such as disease rate per 1000 individuals, enabling more insightful analysis. The dashboard also incorporates stratified views by age, gender, and ethnicity, making it highly dynamic and user-responsive. It demonstrates my proficiency in advanced Tableau features like dual-axis charts, field hierarchies, and filter actions for multi-level analysis.</p>
